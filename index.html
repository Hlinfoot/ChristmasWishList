        <h1 class="introduction">Hello Mom and Dad!</h1>
        <p class="summary">I made this website because I want stuff for Christmas.  I don't expect much, in fact, I barely expect anything at all.  
            So when you see my list, don't think I expect any of it. 
            But I've learned through prayer (yes actually) that it is okay to ask for the big stuff.  
            Just because I may not deserve something, it doesn't mean God doesn't want to know what I want.  
            This list is really just a superficial version of that philosphy.  Obiously these are just material things.  
            But in other words, there's no risk in asking! So here it my list, just follow the button below!  Oh, also this is a work in progess. 
            So maybe check in on it every now and then if you want updates?  Thank you! I love you!</p>
